1.Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Ans. class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        two_sum = []
        for x in range(len(nums)):
            for y in range(x+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[x] + nums[y] == target:
                    two_sum.append(x)
                    two_sum.append(y)
        return two_sum

2.Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. 
If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Ans. class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        max_range = 2**31 -1
        min_range = -2**31
        sign = -1
        num = int(str(x)[::-1])
        if int(num) > max_range or int(num) < min_range:
            return 0
        else:
            return num

3.You are the manager of a supermarket.
You have a list of  items together with their prices that consumers bought on a particular day.
Your task is to print each item_name and net_price in order of its first occurrence.

item_name = Name of the item.
net_price = Quantity of the item sold multiplied by the price of each item.
Ans.   from collections import OrderedDict
	n = int(input())
	d = OrderedDict()
	for x in range(n):
    		item = input().split(" ")
    		price = int(item[-1])
    		item_name = " ".join(item[:-1])
    	if d.get(item_name):
        	d[item_name] += price
    	else:
        	d[item_name] = price

	for keys,values in d.items():
    		print(keys + " " + str(values))

4.Students of District College have a subscription to English and French newspapers. 
Some students have subscribed to only the English newspaper, some have subscribed to only the French newspaper, 
and some have subscribed to both newspapers.You are given two sets of student roll numbers. 
One set has subscribed to the English newspaper, and one set has subscribed to the French newspaper. 
Your task is to find the total number of students who have subscribed to only English newspapers.

a = int(input())
eng = list(map(int, input().split()))
c = int(input())
fre = list(map(int, input().split()))
eng_set = set(eng)
fre_set = set(fre)
count = 0
for x in eng_set:
    if x not in fre_set:
        count += 1

print(count)
